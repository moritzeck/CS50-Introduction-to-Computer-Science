# CS50-Introduction-to-Computer-Science
This repository is just used to showcase my solutions for the several tasks of the course "CS50's Introduction to Computer Science" from the Harvard University. 
I linked the specific task to each solution at the top of every file.

In the end I can only recommend you to work through the various problem sets yourself.
